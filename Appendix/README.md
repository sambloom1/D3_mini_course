## SVG Lesson

### Basic shapes 
**rect** - an element that has attriubutes x, y, width, height. used for bars squares and rectangles <br>
**line** - x1,y1,x2,y2 <br>
**circle** - cx, cy, r <br>
**ellipse** - cx, cy, rx,ry <br>
**text** - x, y, font-family, font-size, text-anchor, dominant-baseline <br>
     with text elements attributes are set in the opening bracket with the text to be displayed written between the opening and closed.<br>

**path** - d attribute which stands for to draw. M, C, E ?? <br>

**grouped <g></g>** groups all elements together that the brackets encapuslates. the attriubutes are set in opening <g..> <br>


### Transform and translate 
The attribute transform and passing translate means we can 'translate' or move the pixels from one area of the SVG to the other. The values within translate link to the direction of the SVG. <br>
.attr("transform", "translate(50,100)"); Would move the element 50 pixels to the right and 100 pixels down.
